	title  "Building DSL using Groovy"
	description """
	Domain Specific Languages (DSLs) have become a valuable part of the Groovy idiom. DSLs are used in native Groovy builders, Grails and GORM, and testing frameworks. To a developer, DSLs are consumable and understandable, which makes implementation more fluid compared to traditional programming. But how is a DSL implemented? How does it work behind the scenes?
	
	In this talk, we will talk about DSL and how can we write DSL using Groovy with various examples and see the significance of DSL
